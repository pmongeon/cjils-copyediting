# Tables {.unnumbered}

## One vs two column tables

### Single Column Table

```{latex}
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

### Two-Column Table

```{latex}
\begin{table*}
  \begin{tabularx}
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table*}
```

### Long Tables

#### Two column

```{latex}
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable}
  \end{longtable}
\end{table*}
```

## Table Position

LaTeX will not always put your table exactly where you placed it in the text due to its internal layout rules. **If** the default position is not ideal, you can attempt giving LaTeX some instructions to better position the table.

If you're happy with the table placement, you don't have to do anything.

### Specifiers

| Specifier  | Meaning                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| h          | Place the table **here**, roughly at the current location   |
| t          | Place the table at the **top** of the page                  |
| b          | Place the table at the **bottom** of the page               |
| p          | Place the table on a **separate page** for floats only      |
| !          | Override LaTeXâ€™s internal float placement rules             |
| H          | Place the table **exactly here** (requires `float` package) |

### Example

```{latex}
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable}
  \end{longtable}
\end{table*}
```

### Tips and tricks

-   You can combine them (e.g.,`[htbp!]` )to give LaTeX flexibility while nudging it toward your preferred location.

-   It is recommended not to use \[h\] alone, as it can sometimes be ignored. Prefer \[ht\] or \[htbp\].

## Do not fight LaTeX

Often, you might find that latex is not at all cooperating with you when it comes to positioning tables. My advice is to not die on that hill. Your table is showing up somewhere in the document. It looks good, but it's not where you want it, so you spend a few minutes trying different strategies to move it to a better spot. No luck? Just move on.

## Caption

The caption is the first element in the table.

```{latex}
\caption{\label{tbl-mytable}\textit{title of the table goes here}}
```

## Columns

```{latex}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{%
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1.5in} 
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5in}
  >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{2.5in} 
}
```

### Alignment

-   **left:** \\raggedright\\arraybackslash
-   **center:** \\centeringt\\arraybackslash
-   **right:** \\raggedleftt\\arraybackslash

### Column width

the **{\\textwidth}** part of the code above ensures sets your table to cover the whole horizontal space it has available.

The dimentions indicated in the format **p{1.5in}** is the part that actually sets the width of the column. You should make sure that the column width is optimal for the content, and that the total of all the column width is equal to the witdth of the horizontal space availabe.

For single column table, the total available space is **8.65cm** or **3.41in**. For a two-column table, the total available space is about **16.51cm** or **6.5in**. As you can see in the latex code above, the total for the three column is actually 6.5 inches because the table is spanning two columns (as indicated by the use of tabularx.

## Linebreak after caption

Add **\\tabularnewline** before you start adding rows to the table. Like this.

```{latex}

  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1.5in} 
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5in}
  >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{2.5in} 
}
\tabularnewline
```

## Rows

-   Each cell is separated by an **ampersand (&).**
-   Each row ends with two backslashes (linebreak): **\\\\**

Here is an example.

```{latex}
first cell content & second cell content & third cell content \\
```

## Borders

-   **\\toprule** for the boder at the top of the table.
-   **\\midrule** for the border below the header row.
-   **\\bottomrule** for the border at the end of the table.
-   **\\cline{}** for a line that doesn't go across the entire table but just for a specific set of columns. For example, \\cline{2-3} will draw a line only for columns 2 and 3.

Here is an example. Note that the \\textbf{} is used to make the column header bold, which is the standard practice for CJILS manuscript.

```{latex}
\toprule
\textbf{First name} & \textbf{Last name} & \textbf{Date of birth} \\
\midrule
John & Smith & July 14, 1975 \\
Mary & Robinson & March 6, 1979 \\
\bottomrule
```

## Merging rows and columns

### Merging columns

If you want for a cell to span two columns, you can do this with **\\multicolumn{}{}{}**. The first curly bracket is for the numbers of columns to span, the second is for alignment (l, c, or r), and the third is for the content. Here is an example where I merge the last two columns for the first row. The table has three columns, so every row should have two &. However, we can see that the first row as only one & and a cell spanning 2 columns.

```{latex}
  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{5.25cm}
    >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{1cm}
    >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{1cm}
  }
  \toprule
   & \multicolumn{2}{r}{Publication} \\
  Country & N & Pct. \\
  \midrule
  Canada & 20 & 80\% \\
  United States & 5 & 20\% \\
  \bottomrule
```

### Merging rows

Merging rows kind of works the same way with **\\multirow{number of rows}{\*}{content}**.I'm not too sure what the star does, but it's normally there.

```{latex}
  \toprule
  \multirow{2}{*}{Country} & \multicolumn{2}{r}{Publication} \\
  & N & Pct. \\
  \midrule
  Canada & 20 & 80\% \\
  United States & 5 & 20\% \\
  \bottomrule
```

## Notes

Adding footnotes to a table is done manually, by adding the a superscript in the cell that will refer to the note, and then adding a row that spans all columns at the end of the table. Note that the **\\\\\[-1.75ex\]** is there to add a small space between the last column and the footnote.

```{latex}
\toprule
\textbf{First name} & \textbf{Last name} & \textbf{Date of birth}
\bottomrule\textit{\textsuperscript{*}} \\
\midrule
John & Smith & July 14, 1975 \\
Mary & Robinson & March 6, 1979 \\
\bottomrule
\\[-1.75ex]
\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textsuperscript{*}This is a table not related to the date of birth column.} \\

```

## Putting it all together

```{latex}
\begin{table}
  \caption{Distribution of CJILS publications by country}
  \label{test}
  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{5.25cm}
    >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{1cm}
    >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{1cm}
  }
  \\
  \toprule
  \multirow{2}[b]{*}[-1.75ex]{Country} & \multicolumn{2}{r}{Publication\textsuperscript{*}} \\
  \cline{2-3}
  \\[-1.75ex]
  & N & Pct. \\
  \midrule
  Canada & 20 & 80\% \\
  United States & 5 & 20\% \\
  \bottomrule
  \\[-1.75ex]
  \multicolumn{3}{l}{\textsuperscript{*}Only includes research articles.}
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

## Tips and tricks

### Copy pasting from Word

You don't need to design your table from scratch, when in **visual mode** in Overleaf, you can copy and paste the table from word and you will just have to edit the automatically generated code rather than starting from scratch. This can save a lot of time.

### Copilot

Copilot (or other AI tools I would imagine) can help you fix your table.... it's not working. Copy your entire code from \\begin{table} to \\end{table} in a prompt that looks like this:

> This does not work:\
> \[paste your code here.\]

Of course, you can be more specific about the issue.
