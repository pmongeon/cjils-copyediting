# Tables {.unnumbered}

## One vs two column tables

### Single Column Table

```{latex}
\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
```

### Two-Column Table

```{latex}
\begin{table*}
  \begin{tabularx}
  \end{tabularx}
\end{table*}
```

### Long Tables

#### Two column

```{latex}
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable}
  \end{longtable}
\end{table*}
```

## Table Position

LaTeX will not always put your table exactly where you placed it in the text due to its internal layout rules. **If** the default position is not ideal, you can attempt giving LaTeX some instructions to better position the table.

If you're happy with the table placement, you don't have to do anything.

### Specifiers

| Specifier  | Meaning                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| h          | Place the table **here**, roughly at the current location   |
| t          | Place the table at the **top** of the page                  |
| b          | Place the table at the **bottom** of the page               |
| p          | Place the table on a **separate page** for floats only      |
| !          | Override LaTeXâ€™s internal float placement rules             |
| H          | Place the table **exactly here** (requires `float` package) |

### Example

```{latex}
\begin{table*}
  \begin{longtable}
  \end{longtable}
\end{table*}
```

### Tips and tricks

-   You can combine them (e.g.,`[htbp!]` )to give LaTeX flexibility while nudging it toward your preferred location.

-   It is recommended not to use \[h\] alone, as it can sometimes be ignored. Prefer \[ht\] or \[htbp\].

## Do not fight LaTeX

Often, you might find that latex is not at all cooperating with you when it comes to positioning tables. My advice is to not die on that hill. Your table is showing up somewhere in the document. It looks good, but it's not where you want it, so you spend a few minutes trying different strategies to move it to a better spot. No luck? Just move on.

## Caption

The caption is the first element in the table.

```{latex}
\caption{\label{tbl-mytable}\textit{title of the table goes here}}
```

## Columns

```{latex}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{%
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1.5in} 
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5in}
  >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{2.5in} 
}
```

### Alignment

-   **left:** \\raggedright\\arraybackslash
-   **center:** \\centeringt\\arraybackslash
-   **right:** \\raggedleftt\\arraybackslash

### Column width

the **{\\textwidth}** part of the code above ensures sets your table to cover the whole horizontal space it has available.

The dimentions indicated in the format **p{1.5in}** is the part that actually sets the width of the column. You should make sure that the column width is optimal for the content, and that the total of all the column width is equal to the witdth of the horizontal space availabe.

For single column table, the total available space is **8.65cm** or **3.41in**. For a two-column table, the total available space is about **16.51cm** or **6.5in**. As you can see in the latex code above, the total for the three column is actually 6.5 inches because the table is spanning two columns (as indicated by the use of tabularx.

## Linebreak after caption

Add **\\tabularnewline** before you start adding rows to the table. Like this.

```{latex}

  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{1.5in} 
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5in}
  >{\raggedleft\arraybackslash}p{2.5in} 
}
\tabularnewline
```

## Rows

-   Each cell is separated by an **ampersand (&).**
-   Each row ends with two backslashes (linebreak): **\\\\**

Here is an example.

```{latex}
first cell content & second cell content & third cell content \\
```

## Borders

-   **\\toprule** for the boder at the top of the table.
-   **\\midrule** for the border below the header row.
-   **\\bottomrule** for the border at the end of the table.

Here is an example. Note that the \\textbf{} is used to make the column header bold, which is the standard practice for CJILS manuscript.

```{latex}
\toprule
\textbf{First name} & \textbf{Last name} & \textbf{Date of birth} \\
\midrule
John & Smith & July 14, 1975 \\
Mary & Robinson & March 6, 1979 \\
\bottomrule
```

## Notes

Adding footnotes to a table is done manually, by adding the a superscript in the cell that will refer to the note, and then adding a row that spans all columns at the end of the table. Note that the **\\\\\[-1.75ex\]** is there to add a small space between the last column and the footnote.

```{latex}
\toprule
\textbf{First name} & \textbf{Last name} & \textbf{Date of birth}
\bottomrule\textit{\textsuperscript{*}} \\
\midrule
John & Smith & July 14, 1975 \\
Mary & Robinson & March 6, 1979 \\
\bottomrule
\\[-1.75ex]
\multicolumn{3}{l}{\textsuperscript{*}This is a table not related to the date of birth column.} \\
