Just put the text, and put a line break in between paragraphs.\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\nThis is a paragraph.\n\nThis is another paragraph.\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Lists\n\n### Bullet points\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item This is the first bullet point\n  \\item This is the second bullet point\n  \\item this is the third bullet point\n\\end{itemize}\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Numbered lists\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item This is the first item\n  \\item This is the second item\n  \\item this is the third item\n\\end{enumerate}\n```\n\n\n\n\n### Spacing between list items\n\nBy default there will be a empty line between bullet points. That's usually undesirable unless the bullets contain long multi-line text and spacing them out improves readability. So you will often use **\\\\tightlist** to reduce the space between the items. Like this:\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\tightlist\n  \\item This is the first bullet point\n  \\item This is the second bullet point\n  \\item this is the third bullet point\n\\end{itemize}\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Footnotes\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\nThis is a text.\\footnote{and this is the footnote for that text.}\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Citations\n\nAt this point we write citations manually, directly in the paragraph so there is nothing specific to do other than making sure they are in proper APA 7 format.\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\nThis is a bit of text in a paragraph (Some author, 2022).\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Quotes\n\nQuotes can go straight in the text when less than 40 words or three lines, otherwise use a long quote.\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\begin{quote}\n  This is a quote \n\\end{quote}\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Hyperlinks\n\nuse the **\\\\url{}**\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\url{https://www.somewebsite.ca/}\n```\n\n",
