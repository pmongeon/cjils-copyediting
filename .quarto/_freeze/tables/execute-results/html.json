Prefer \\[ht\\] or \\[htbp\\].\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Do not fight LaTeX\n\nOften, you might find that latex is not at all cooperating with you when it comes to positioning tables. My advice is to not die on that hill. Your table is showing up somewhere in the document. It looks good, but it's not where you want it, so you spend a few minutes trying different strategies to move it to a better spot. No luck? Just move on.\n:::\n\n## Caption\n\nThe caption is the first element in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\caption{\\label{tbl-mytable}\\textit{title of the table goes here}}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Columns\n\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\begin{tabularx}{\\textwidth}{%\n  >{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{1.5in} \n  >{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{2.5in}\n  >{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{2.5in} \n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n### Alignment\n\n-   **left:** \\\\raggedright\\\\arraybackslash\n-   **center:** \\\\centeringt\\\\arraybackslash\n-   **right:** \\\\raggedleftt\\\\arraybackslash\n\n### Column width\n\nthe **{\\\\textwidth}** part of the code above ensures sets your table to cover the whole horizontal space it has available.\n\nThe dimentions indicated in the format **p{1.5in}** is the part that actually sets the width of the column. You should make sure that the column width is optimal for the content, and that the total of all the column width is equal to the witdth of the horizontal space availabe.\n\nFor single column table, the total available space is **8.65cm** or **3.41in**. For a two-column table, the total available space is about **16.51cm** or **6.5in**. As you can see in the latex code above, the total for the three column is actually 6.5 inches because the table is spanning two columns (as indicated by the use of tabularx.\n\n## Linebreak after caption\n\nAdd **\\\\tabularnewline** before you start adding rows to the table. Like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\n  >{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{1.5in} \n  >{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{2.5in}\n  >{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}p{2.5in} \n}\n\\tabularnewline\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Rows\n\n-   Each cell is separated by an **ampersand (&).**\n-   Each row ends with two backslashes (linebreak): **\\\\\\\\**\n\nHere is an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\nfirst cell content & second cell content & third cell content \\\\\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Borders\n\n-   **\\\\toprule** for the boder at the top of the table.\n-   **\\\\midrule** for the border below the header row.\n-   **\\\\bottomrule** for the border at the end of the table.\n\nHere is an example. Note that the \\\\textbf{} is used to make the column header bold, which is the standard practice for CJILS manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{First name} & \\textbf{Last name} & \\textbf{Date of birth} \\\\\n\\midrule\nJohn & Smith & July 14, 1975 \\\\\nMary & Robinson & March 6, 1979 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Merging rows and columns\n\n### Merging columns\n\n### Merging rows\n\n## Notes\n\nAdding footnotes to a table is done manually, by adding the a superscript in the cell that will refer to the note, and then adding a row that spans all columns at the end of the table. Note that the **\\\\\\\\\\[-1.75ex\\]** is there to add a small space between the last column and the footnote.\n\n\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\toprule\n\\textbf{First name} & \\textbf{Last name} & \\textbf{Date of birth}\n\\bottomrule\\textit{\\textsuperscript{*}} \\\\\n\\midrule\nJohn & Smith & July 14, 1975 \\\\\nMary & Robinson & March 6, 1979 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\\\[-1.75ex]\n\\multicolumn{3}{l}{\\textsuperscript{*}This is a table not related to the date of birth column.} \\\\\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Tips and tricks\n\n### Copy pasting from Word\n\n### Copilot\n\n",
